# GitBook Activity 6.3

  
There are many factors that contribute to effective web design with varying effects on the way someone might think about writing their site:

1.      Knowing your Audience – Use language your average user will be familiar with. Tailor your tone to make your information seem most meaningful \(e.g. conversational, professional, casual\).

2.      Understanding how People Read on the Web – Knowing the best medium to use to present information is key to ensuring that your users are able to effectively absorb it. Typically, excessive use of any one medium is sub-optimal, breaking up content into varying sizes and formats makes it easier to interpret. Be aware that many users will simply scan over writing, and try to accommodate that style of reading.

3.      Following the ‘Inverted Pyramid Model – Users want and need to see the most important information front and center. Begin with the most relevant content, and allow the user to go deeper to find specifics.

4.      Keeping Content Short and Simple – Users prefer not to digest large amounts of content, so large blocks of text should be avoided – either by breaking them up, or by using videos, images, and diagrams to convey information in a more palatable medium.

5.      Chunking Content – It is important to separate content into manageable sections, so that users can not only identify differentiated blocks of content, but digest it more sustainably.

6.      Using the Active Voice – To enhance the clarity of presented information, using active voice is key \(i.e. subject, action, object\). Writing in the active voice minimizes subtlety and makes messages seem more direct and clear by placing them in the present tense.

7.      Putting Content into Context – Support writing with images and headers to place information into suitable contexts – draw users’ eyes to the right places so that it can be registered and interpreted correctly.

8.      Editing and Proofreading – Errors and mistakes can critically impact users’ trust in the credibility of your information. Ensuring that grammar and spelling is meticulous will make writing appear more professional and trustworthy regardless of the tone.

Four examples of technology where user interface design is an important consideration are:

-        Mobile Phones

-        Eftpos Machines

-        Smart Watches

-        Self-Service Check-In Kiosks

Many aspects of user interface design for desktops and laptops is not applicable to these, as each have different usability requirements they need to fulfill.

The user interface design for Mobile phones must differ in that though they often must still facilitate desktop apps’ functions and elements, they have significantly less screen space and rely on touch. Consequently, elements must be larger, yet will ideally retain the same feel and spatial complexity. For example, drop-down menus must typically cover at least half the screen, which is something that must be considered for an app’s layout.

Eftpos machines’ interfaces are similarly small, but far less concerned with optics. In order to process a transaction as efficiently as possible, the design must be consistent and clear. For these reasons, almost all space on the screen will be taken up by buttons or information, with white space only existing to differentiate elements.

Smart watches are tiny compared to other screens, but they must still attempt to maintain clarity and usability. Usually this is accomplished by displaying only small amounts of information on each page, requiring users to pass between pages frequently; or by having information scroll across, meaning it cannot all be read at the same time, but switching pages is not required.

Self-Service check-in kiosks are typically quite large, measuring to a similar or larger size than the average desktop monitor. consistency and usability in unison are crucial, as both of these elements assist the user in completing the task as painlessly as possible. Large, well divided elements must be used to aid in ease of navigation, and touch keyboards must occupy a large portion of the screen to prevent user frustration with typing errors.

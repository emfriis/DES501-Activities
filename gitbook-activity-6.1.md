# GitBook Activity 6.1

1.      A good web experience is based on consistency and clarity. Elements should be intuitive as to their purpose â€“ buttons should look like buttons; text should look like text. Design should be streamlined in that all elements of the same kind should function and appear the same way. Users should be able to identify where they are in a website at all times, and should be able to, without significant effort, navigate to specific pages.

2.      Age, culture, and previous experience all seem to represent different shades of the same thing with regards to web experience, as in the degree and type of exposure an individual has had to web pages. Those with little exposure prefer high uniformity \(i.e. consistency\), allowing them to apply previously learned information, whereas those with more exposure are more focused on the flow of a website \(i.e. clarity\), which can allow them to navigate the site quickly and intuitively.

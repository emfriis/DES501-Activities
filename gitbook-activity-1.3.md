The position that most appeals to me is the Software Quality Assurance Engineer listing. I feel this kind of position would suit me because of the predictive elements, constantly changing environment, self-directing method of work, and planning requirements, as I feel like I would thrive in this type of environment.

I also like the idea of the position of Data Solutions Developer because of the breadth of work involved and the process of design and development.

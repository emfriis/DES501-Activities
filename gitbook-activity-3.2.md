# GitBook Activity 3.2

The agile model of software development focuses primarily on an iterative process, based on a high frequency of communication, collaboration, and customer engagement, in order to produce a product that is constantly evolving and completed in the smallest possible time-frame. Within an agile model, fully working software is ideally delivered every weekly cycle, with daily collaboration occurring between agile team members and the agile team leader, as well as between the customer and the agile team leader, to ensure all stakeholders are on the same page about the requirements and vision with regards to the rapidly delivered software. The agile model can fall apart when there is a lack of trust or a dissimilarity in capability between agile team members, as this may result in failing to meet delivery expectations. Additionally, unless the customer is able to accurately represent their operational requirements, the end product of the agile development is unlikely to be representative of their actual needs.

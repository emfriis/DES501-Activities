-        Business Strategy generally refers to the decisions and actions taken by a business in order to achieve its overarching goals. Information technology is fundamental to almost all business processes towards the ends of cost reduction, communication improvement, productivity enhancement and more. In this way business strategy is impacted by technology in that all business decisions and actions must be informed by an understanding of requirements and costs of IT infrastructure and the opportunities and drawbacks of utilising technology to improve business functions.

-        Organisational Culture is the unique collective personality of an organisation, comprised of the values and beliefs held by the people within that organisation. Every organisation develops an organisational culture over time, and that culture tends to strongly influence both business strategy and organisational structure. Conversely, technology’s influence on business strategy will also influence organisational culture through changes to the way employees and customers operate and communicate as a result of developing and utilising new IT systems.

-        Organisational Structure refers to the array of positions and hierarchies within an organisation, ideally sculpted to best reflect a business’s goals and organisational culture. Technology influences organisational structure in that the degree of specialisation and separation between divisions are often influenced by the requirements to utilise and maintain technological architecture, resulting in business roles being created and adapted to maximise outputs.

-        Business Processes are the set of actions taken to produce a product or render a service to a consumer. Technology is bound to affect this aspect of business, given that it is utilised at every step in the value chain, meaning business processes must be built around, and to integrate, all relevant technology.

-        The nature of work across many jobs and workplaces have been thoroughly impacted by advances in technology, through fundamental changes to the way people interact or communicate with businesses. Brick and Mortar style work environments become less and less favourable as the integration of technology into all aspects of business shifts the channels through which businesses can best access clients, whether through call centers, tech support, online shopping, and many other methods.

-        The workplace itself is also impacted heavily by technology. Some jobs that don’t require face-to-face interaction may allow their employees to work through their computers at home, others might shift to large-building, multi-cubicle setups. In cases such as these, the requirements brought on by expanded scope through IT influence the ideal location of employees.

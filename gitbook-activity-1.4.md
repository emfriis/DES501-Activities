# GitBook Activity 1.4

Having roles focused on forward thinking innovation within an IT business is likely to affect the structure of that business in a way that either forces division or specialization, in order to maximize the value of that business’s outputs within the context of factors such as culture and the needs of their customers.

A functional organisational structure often arises as a result of a business requiring a specific set of technical and system skills across a number of important operations. In these instances, quick and informed decision making and communication are important; and thereby structuring an IT business to favour high levels of specialization will allow operations to run more efficiently than if IT roles had a more general scope of knowledge.

Comparatively, divisional organisational structures form as a result of businesses’ expansion and broadening of scope. In this case, in order to maintain a focus on forward thinking innovation, a growing business must divide its business structure by divisions. Within a divisional structure, several parallel divisions each function autonomously and independently while still reporting to a top management authority. By having each division operate as a single unit within the larger, growing business, that business is more capable of accommodating the more general needs of its systems and customers as it expands.

In both of these cases, the organisational structure of a business must also reflect the culture present within that organisation, else the structure and its roles and hierarchies will not be properly upheld by the business’s employees. Therefore, in order for a forward-thinking, innovative approach to organisational structure to be effective, business strategy must also take into account the values held by its employees, and the importance they place on different ideologies, else an incompatible structure may result in dysfunction and a reduction in outputs.

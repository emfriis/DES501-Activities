# Gitbook Activity 2.2

One of the IT businesses we looked at in Topic 1 of DES501 was Xero, an online accounting software provider. The primary stockholders for Xero in terms of information management include:

-        External Stakeholders:

·        Xero’s customers, who are invested in the appropriate storage, security, and eventual disposal of their valuable financial information, given that the livelihood of their personal finances and businesses are at stake.

·        Banks, which are integral to Xero’s information collection, also are invested in the financial well being of their customers, and thereby in the quality and security of Xero’s information management processes.

-        Internal Stakeholders:

·        Xero’s information management employees, who are internally responsible for assuring the effective collection, curation, storage, dissemination, archiving, and destruction of customer data as part of their jobs \(as well as managers responsible for decision making related to information management processes\) with the end goal of creating value for both Xero and their customers.

·        Xero’s owners and shareholders, for whom information management represents a large component of Xero’s value chain, contributing to profit margin and thereafter return on investment.

Secondary stakeholders might also include the wider public & community \(who also might stand to benefit or lose from the outcomes of Xero's information management processes\), as well as rival businesses \(who may compare the cost effectiveness and efficiency of their information management processes to those of Xero's\), who have no direct involvement with Xero.

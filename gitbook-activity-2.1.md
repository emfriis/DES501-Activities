-        Collection of information, the acts of gathering and measurement with the intention of accumulating relevant information.

-        Curation of information, sorting and organizing information that is relevant to the creation of value.

-        Storage of information, establishing redundancy and accessibility for valuable information.

-        Dissemination of information, distribution of information using the methods most likely to maximise the value of that data.

-        Archiving of information, compression and filing away of large quantities of information with potential future applicability.

-        Destruction of information, discarding information that is no longer valuable, or information with a legally prescribed lifespan.
